## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Kenneth

- Thanks for popping by! I'm a data scientist and a dual-licensed pharmacist with expertise in technical writing and full-stack web development
- An avid learner and driven doer with a bias towards action, I enjoy learning, seeking, and solving meaningful problems with the use of technology and data.
- I welcome you to join me on a data/tech learning journey! Feel free to give me a follow on Medium (https://kennethleungty.medium.com) or on LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/kennethleungty) to stay in the loop of exciting and insightful content.
- Do give my data science portfolio a look, where each project and article was born out of personal inspiration and motivation. Don't hesitate to hit me up for a discussion on topics common to both of us!
